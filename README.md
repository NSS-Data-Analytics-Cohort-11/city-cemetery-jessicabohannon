This project features cleaning and analysis of data from the Historic Nashville City Cemetery 1846-1979. Cleaning was focused on Cause of Death, considering significant inconsistent spellings and overlapping disease names. Columns added for analysis include Last Name, Age Group, Age Category, Decade (of Death), and Year Group. Analysis was performed with a combination of pivot tables, advanced Excel functions, and visualizations.

Questions asked and visualized during initial analysis include:
* What were the 10 most common known recorded causes of death?
* What is the trend in burials per year? Why did some years have more burials?
* Looking at burials per month and year, which months stand out? (Using heat map)
* What is the proportion of male and female burials and how has it changed over time?
* How has age at time of death changed over time?
* What were the most common last names of people buried in the cemetery?

After this initial data analysis, I noticed a trend in cholera outbreaks and took a closer look. I investigated cholera outbreaks through the months and years, connecting my findings to historical events and our current understandings of the disease.

This project highlights my skill in employing Excel for effective data analysis and visualization, along with the ability to weave compelling narratives through data storytelling. I trust it will offer a captivating glimpse into historical trends.

Skills used:
* Data cleaning
* Pivot tables
